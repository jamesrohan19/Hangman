# Hangman
This is a simple Hangman game. Guess the correct letters in the word without being hanged.

Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!

You can find the code in Hangman > task > hangman > hangman.py
